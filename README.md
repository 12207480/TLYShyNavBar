# TLYShyNavBar

This component helps you mimick the navigation bar expansion/contraction that you see in the facebook, instagram and other apps. Not only that, but with the ability to add an additional extension that expands/contracts as well! It is designed for ease of use, and is battle tested in our own [Telly app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telly/id524552885?mt=8)<sup>[1]</sup>!

<sub>[1]: AppStore version doesn't have the latest, though. Coming soon. :grin:</sub>
